Find PGP keys with formats/packets I have never seen before
Make error handling more reasonable (currently everything throws exceptions)
Recalculate signature functions
encrypt+sign at once
finish sign functions
add wrapper function to generically use any of the sign/verify functions
find packets properly (check if uid is associated with key, etc)
maybe make compression algorithms consume data instead of just reading it (might not be using all the data)
read partial packets properly
get verify-key to work for keys with other people's signatures
