Make error handling more reasonable? (currently everything throws exceptions)
Recalculate signature functions
encrypt+sign stuff
finish sign functions
wrapper function to generically use any of the sign/verify functions
find packets properly (check if uid is associated with key, etc)
read partial packets properly
